SatoshiLabs
===========

Launched in late 2013, SatoshiLabs is a company created by experienced
specialists and enthusiasts located in Prague, the heart of Europe. Our
projects tackle wide range of topics from bitcoin mining to easy and secure
bitcoin storage and transactions. We focus on user experience while preserving
the top security bitcoin provides.

Our team brought several unique and well known projects such as Slush's Pool,
the world's first mining pool, TREZOR, the world's first bitcoin hardware
wallet, or Coinmap, the most visited map showing places accepting Bitcoin.

We raise the public awareness about bitcoin and cryptography in general and we
are rather investing our time and knowledge into useful projects rather than to
speculations. Currently our team counts 10 highly motivated and skilled
programmers, client support and sales specialists lead by the three founders of
SatoshiLabs: Alena, Marek and Pavol.

The goal of SatoshiLabs is to support and develop new bitcoin projects leading
to faster adoption of Bitcoin and easy and secure tools for bitcoin owners. The
team of SatoshiLabs is ready to provide professional help to those who have
ideas and seek technical expertise, financial resources or marketing service.
