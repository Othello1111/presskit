Slush Pool
============

The idea of mining in a pool
----------------------------

"When I launched the pool, bitcoin had globally around 3000 users and it was
not easy to convince people to start mining in a pool. With a difficulty of
15000, it was still possible to mine blocks for a single miner equipped with a
decent GPU card. Nevertheless, it was clear to me that very soon reasonable
rewards for an individual miner would become a dream. I thought that a pooled
infrastructure and a mathematical formula for a fair rewards distribution could
make a big difference", describes Marek Palatinus the birth of the Slush's
Pool.

History
-------

The Slush Pool was introduced in late 2010 and since then it attracted more
than 630 000 miners over time. Within few months a new protocol called Stratum
became to an existence. This protocol proved to be perfectly suitable to
support upcoming terahash-strong miners and has been adopted by all major
pools. Thanks to this innovation, mining pools are ready for a difficulties we
see nowadays.
