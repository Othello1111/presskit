Coinmap
=======

Where to spend my bitcoins?
---------------------------

This is the question lot of bitcoin owners are asking themselves. We believe
Bitcoin does not belong just to the online world, but has also its place in
everyday real world situations. Many bitcoiners want to spend their coins in a
restaurant or support a local service provider and bitcoin accepting businesses
need to be discovered and located easily. That is why Coinmap came to life.

Collaborative editing
---------------------

In 2013 we introduced Coinmap which uses OpenStreetMap collaborative project as
its data source. It gained a lot of popularity quickly and today it is the most
used cryptocurrency map, not only just to locate business but various sources
use it to monitor the bitcoin economy and its momentum.

Future plans
------------

With almost 5000 Coinmap entries and even faster growing number of bitcoin
businesses we plan to make Coinmap more user friendly and introduce advanced
features. Keep an eye on its development.
