SatoshiLabs
===========

Launched in late 2013, SatoshiLabs is a company created by experienced
specialists and enthusiasts located in Prague, the heart of Europe. Our
projects tackle wide range of topics from bitcoin mining to easy and secure
bitcoin storage and transactions. We focus on user experience while preserving
the top security bitcoin provides.

Our team brought several unique and well known projects such as Slush Pool,
the world's first mining pool, TREZOR, the world's first bitcoin hardware
wallet, or Coinmap, the most visited map showing places accepting Bitcoin.

We raise the public awareness about bitcoin and cryptography in general and we
are rather investing our time and knowledge into useful projects rather than to
speculations. Currently our team counts 15 highly motivated and skilled
programmers, client support and sales specialists.

The goal of SatoshiLabs is to support and develop new bitcoin projects leading
to faster adoption of Bitcoin and easy and secure tools for bitcoin owners. The
team of SatoshiLabs is ready to provide professional help to those who have
ideas and seek technical expertise, financial resources or marketing service.

	"We are ambitious pioneers of technology, who strive to bring cryptography to the masses! Innovation is our engine; never-ending research and development keeps us at the top. Our aim is to understand and deliver secure yet easy-to-use solutions to real problems. We create and foster our open-source cryptography environment, the “TREZOR ecosystem,” for which we continuously develop flagship applications."
